# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This is an individual assignment in my Business Intelligence course where I needed to yield a business report about summer clothes sales performance. The report must capture key insights and offer recommendations. Target audience is the management team that leads summer clothes sales and wants to know what has happened and what to improve or focus on for future business activities.

## Length requirement
No more than 15 pages, including everything.

## Tool requirement
All the figures used in the report must be produced by Power BI.

# DATA MANIPULATION
Before visualising the data, I did some data manipulations as follows:
- Create new variable: Revenue = units sold * unit price
- Separate tags: gender tags (into "male" vs. "female"), product type (into "clothing" vs. "non-clothing"), and clothing variations (into "shirt", "dress", "top", "trousers", "suit" etc.)

# KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS (detail in the "Wish summer clothes sales performance" file)
## Key insights (illustrated as slide titles)

### Product analysis
- Products sold are mainly female clothes.
- Ad is used effectively to boost sales.
- Customers are overall satisfied with the products.
- Customer satisfaction affects sales performance.

### Merchant analysis
- Merchant reputation matters to sales growth.
- Merchants utilise ad to boost performance.
- Merchants employe promotional pricing to attract sales.

## Recommendations (explained in the last slide)
- To have a more well-rounded product sales portfolio, wish can try promoting male products as well as other non-clothing items.
- Customer satisfaction and sales performance are closely correlated.
- The promotional pricing should be used cautiously as it may not be cost-efficient in the long run.
